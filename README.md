# JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository is intended to store the exercise list codes. Solving these exercises, I aim to learn a new language through practice and thus improve my logical thinking as a programmer.

More complex code or larger projects that involve JS will have their own repository. This serves only as a place to store solved exercises and small projects.
## RUN

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/keuwey/javascript-na-pratica.git
